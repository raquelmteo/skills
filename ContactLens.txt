This is a data set for fitting contact lenses (taken from Cendrowska, 1987; the data
are available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository). The variable to be
predicted is whether a patient should be fitted with hard, soft, or no contact lenses.
Four patient attributes (all categorical data on nominal scales) are available to make
this choice:

• age {young, pre-presbyopic, presbyopic}
• spectacle-prescription {myope, hypermetrope}
• astigmatism {no, yes}
• tear-prod-rate {reduced, normal}

A listing of all 24 combinations of attributes and the recommended decisions
on the fitting of contact lenses is given in the file ContactLens.csv. The complete
tree is shown later; it leads to a perfect description, with no errors. A
somewhat simpler tree, with three terminal nodes and just two attributes (tear
production rate and astigmatism), recommends no contact lenses for patients with
reduced tear production; soft contacts for patients with normal tear production
and no astigmatism; and hard contact lenses for patients with normal tear production
and astigmatism present. This tree misclassifies 3 of the 24 possible attribute
combinations.
